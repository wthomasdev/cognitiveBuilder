I have made three queries, to use on the data set provided:
 * Query1 looks for Machine Learning books with negative sentiment. Warning the user which books to avoid.

 * Query2 is returning results with positive sentiment, specifically title and price. These are the books that would most suit the users requirements.

 * Query3 is looking at Data Mining in particular and is using a filter to show results where there is a >0.8 relevance for the term 'Data Mining'.
